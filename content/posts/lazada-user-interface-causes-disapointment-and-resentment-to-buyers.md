First week of August, I bought a Raspberry Pi in Lazada. Since it needs a keyboard and mouse and I don’t have one, I searched and bought as well. I selected one that’s unbranded and cheap since this is only for a hobby. I can always upgrade later if needed.

Below was the item I thought I was buying and getting:

Fast forward to delivery day of the supposed keyboard and mouse, I only received one item: “mouse only”.

Talked to the seller and got told that my order was for a mouse only. Seller showed me the item's picture with Chinese characters:

I asked the seller to send the keyboard as it seems to be missing. Seller told me to return back the item to them instead. They will send a refund except for the shipping fee. Given that the item only costs around PHP200 + shipping of PHP 99.00, that would be too much effort with less benefit. So in short, I decided to leave a review instead which I thought was fair enough.

I also informed Lazada messages via support center. Direct messaged them as well through Twitter.

Few days after, I noticed that price changes whenever I click the small pictures to the bottom right of the item.

It’s still an issue though: Buyers will NEVER notice it. Here’s what all buyers had in mind when checking items such as this:

Check the images below as I navigate those so called "customized item option":

**Bug or Evil Feature in Lazada**

I  think this is more of a bug than an “evil feature”.  This may give Lazada an unintended profit but will also erode their user’s trust.

**Unsolicited Advise to Sellers**

Do not add multiple option to an item that would confuse your potential buyers. You will get bad reviews and will affect you long term profitability.

**Unsolicited Advise to Lazada**

Hire a more capable usability expert. 

**Update to item review**

I apologized to the seller, updated my review BUT adding only 2 stars... unless Lazada fixes that user-interface issue.
