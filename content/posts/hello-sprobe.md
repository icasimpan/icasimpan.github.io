June 21, 2021 is my official onboarding with [Sprobe, Inc](https://sprobe.com/).
As per my official designation, I'll be working in a project that utilizes bash, awk and postgresql. 
Of course, it should be more than that but I can't tell you much at this point.

I'm currently setting up my workstations which are all Windows 10. 
As I'm a heavy CLI user since my employment at [GoAbroad](https://www.goabroad.com/), I tried installing [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org). 
I find it more convenient and flexible to install and use than [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) while I was working at Nokia Manila TC. 
Turned out, I DON'T NEED it. There's a better and seamless way....WSL or Windows Subsystem for Linux.

Head over to [Windows Subsystem for Linux Installation Guide for Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). 
Install at least one Linux distro and the Windows Terminal. You will have 'sudo' and can access the Windows paths from within the Linux terminal.
