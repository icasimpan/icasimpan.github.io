Previously been working as Software Build Engineer(7+ years) and very much proficient in subversion and lately git. My direct sysadmin experience totals about 10years+ and codes mostly in shell(bash) and distilled in my open source Shell Scripting Development Kit and framework - ShCF. Been proficient in Perl but my skills on it has been rusty lately due to unuse.</description>
